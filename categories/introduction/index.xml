These narratives range from personal memoirs and fiction to films, journalism, and online storytelling. They not only reflect individual journeys of gender identity but also shape public understanding and policy discussions. In recent decades, a growing body of scholarship has examined how transgender people tell their stories and how those stories are framed by society (<a href="https://elearning.unimib.it/pluginfile.php/1501150/mod_resource/content/0/Mason%20Schrock.pdf#:~:text=written%20materials%2C%20the%20present%20study,narratives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6824534/#:~:text=Haas%20et%20al,can%20continue%20to%20prompt%20misunderstandings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>). This survey provides an in-depth literature review of transgender narratives, structured by key themes. First, we offer a broad overview of how transgender narratives appear in literature, media, and culture. We then explore different types of transgender narratives – including memoir, fiction, film, and political/activist storytelling – and analyze how sociopolitical forces influence these narratives. A comparative look at Eastern vs. Western transgender narratives highlights cross-cultural differences in representation, cultural perceptions, and historical developments. We also examine interdisciplinary perspectives (psychological, sociological, and philosophical) on transgender identity and narrative, and discuss the role of digital and social media in shaping contemporary trans storytelling. Throughout, we include both foundational works with high scholarly citation counts and recent publications from the last 10 years, to balance historical context with current developments. By synthesizing over 30 academic sources from journals, books, and reports, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of transgender narratives and their significance in society.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Mirror of the Self: Origins, Branches, and Reflections on Gender-Bender Fiction</title><link>https://www.genderlibs.org/blog/2025/01/mirror-of-the-self-origins-branches-and-reflections-on-gender-bender-fiction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 16:35:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.genderlibs.org/blog/2025/01/mirror-of-the-self-origins-branches-and-reflections-on-gender-bender-fiction/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="mirror-of-the-self-the-origins-branches-and-philosophical-reflections-of-chinese-gender-bender-fiction" data-numberify>Mirror of the Self: The Origins, Branches, and Philosophical Reflections of Chinese Gender-Bender Fiction<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#mirror-of-the-self-the-origins-branches-and-philosophical-reflections-of-chinese-gender-bender-fiction"></a></h1>

<p>Throughout the long course of human history, the question of “the self” has always been unavoidable yet notoriously difficult to pin down. We live in this world with our own unique appearances, personalities, and emotions. And time after time, as we go through different life experiences, we invariably run into confusion about who we are: does the “me” that society recognizes actually align with the “me” I identify with in my heart? When gender—such a core part of our identity—gets transferred or changed, how might our ways of thinking, our emotional needs, and even our entire mode of existence be rattled?</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
