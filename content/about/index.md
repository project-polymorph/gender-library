*Connecting Chinese-speaking communities with the world of gender diversity.*

**GenderLibs** is a digitally curated platform dedicated to sharing, preserving, and amplifying gender-diverse voices from Chinese-speaking regions and beyond. While Chinese is among the most widely spoken languages worldwide, content related to gender diversity in Chinese often remains underrepresented in broader international discussions. By sharing and translating valuable materials, GenderLibs strives to bridge this gap, fostering greater cultural understanding and enabling global conversations.

Through a close partnership with [多元性别中文数字图书馆](https://transchinese.org/), GenderLibs brings together an extensive collection of documents, narratives, research, and media showcasing a wide spectrum of gender expressions and identities—including but not limited to cross-dressing or transforming subculture (*CDTS*), so-called “pseudo-girl” (*伪娘*) and “male-girl” (*男娘*) communities, *MTX* or “male-to-X,” *MTE* or “male-to-everything,” and intersex (*间性人*) individuals. By emphasizing this broad definition of 多元性别 (gender diversity), we reflect the fluidity and cultural nuances of gender identity as it is experienced around the world.

## Our Mission and Commitment

GenderLibs is committed to more than mere archival work. We seek to actively promote dialogue and mutual learning between Chinese-speaking communities and the global public. To fulfill this vision, we collaborate with activists, researchers, and community groups to translate essential materials, hold virtual events, and share insights through our online platform and social media channels. In doing so, we hope to empower individuals, expand knowledge of gender diversity, and foster meaningful cross-cultural exchanges.

Our mission encompasses:

- **Sharing a Multifaceted Perspective**: By spotlighting personal testimonies, scholarly articles, blogs, and community discussions, we aim to provide a comprehensive, nuanced view of gender diversity in both local and global contexts.  
- **Bridging Communities**: We focus on linking Chinese-language resources with an international audience, offering translations and synopses so that people everywhere can benefit from this rich body of work.  
- **Promoting Inclusivity**: GenderLibs welcomes all forms of identity and expression, believing that diversity is enriched by recognizing everyone’s experiences and contributions.

## Looking to the Future

We envision a world in which every individual, regardless of cultural or linguistic background, can readily access stories, research, and shared knowledge about gender diversity. By continuing to expand our collection, partner with like-minded organizations, and encourage participation from community members, we hope to create an evolving digital commons where learning and collaboration thrive.

Ultimately, **GenderLibs: Sino-Global Gender Diversity Library** exists to ensure that the wealth of Chinese-language gender diversity content does not remain isolated. Instead, we want it to shine on the global stage, inspiring insights and connections that transcend borders. We invite you to explore, learn, and contribute—together, we can broaden horizons and champion understanding across cultures and identities.
