title: "扶她 / Futanari"
---

**"扶她"** (Japanese: **ふたなり**, romaji: **Futanari**, literally “dual form”) is a type of character in Japanese ACG (animation, comics, and games) culture. Such fictional characters appear visually female but **also have male genitalia**. As an artistic form of expression, it originally drew from historical Japanese depictions of dual-sex individuals, but in the 1990s it developed into a distinct genre of adult-oriented anime/manga. Later, it spread widely among global ACG fan communities.

Futanari-themed works primarily appear in **adult** productions, distinguished by their unique gender expression and visual impact, forming a subcultural circle. They differ from drag culture or portrayals of transgender individuals; instead, futanari is a **purely fictional** device for sexual fantasy and artistic creation. In Japanese cultural contexts, “扶她” specifically refers to **fictitious** 2D characters and is **not** used to describe real people.

## Cultural and Historical Background

### Origin in Japanese ACG Culture

“扶她” (Japanese “ふたなり,” meaning “dual form”) originally referred in Japanese to individuals or characters with both male and female traits, including real-life intersex people. This concept dates back to ancient Japan: the 12th-century illustrated scroll *Yamai no Sōshi* featured a character with both male and female genitalia, using the word “二形 (ふたなり)” to describe this dual-sex state. In the 17th century, the medical term “futanari” shifted to an aesthetic concept—during the Edo period, kabuki included “二成平” actors known for androgynous allure ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futanari#:~:text=Originally%2C%20the%20Japanese%20language%20referred,that%20depicts%20such%20characters), [2](https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/futanari/#:~:text=refers%20to%20such%20a%20person%E2%80%99s,perceived%20dual%20nature), [3](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E6%89%B6%E4%BB%96%E9%82%A3%E8%A3%A1#:~:text=%E5%90%8C%E4%B8%80%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E5%8F%97%E5%88%B0%E4%BD%9B%E6%95%99%20%E7%9A%84%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%BF%E5%BE%97%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E6%99%AE%E9%81%8D%E8%AE%A4%E4%B8%BA%E7%A5%9E%20%E6%98%8E%E5%B9%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%95%E5%8D%95%E4%B8%80%E7%9A%84%E6%80%A7%E5%88%AB%E3%80%82))). This concept of **“dual sexes”** seeded modern futanari culture. By the late 20th century, Japan’s ACG sphere reinterpreted the word “ふたなり”: from its original usage for real intersex individuals, it gradually became the specific term in the 1990s for **female-appearing characters who have male genitals** in adult works, evolving into a standalone erotic genre.

### Development and Rise in the 1990s

The 1990s were the golden era for futanari in Japan’s 2D adult media. As the previous “loli boom” in adult manga receded, futanari concepts gained traction. **Manga artist Yui Toshiki** published a series of works in the early ’90s—*Wingding Party*, *Junction*, *Hot Junction*—that pioneered futanari manga. His **Hot Tails** later became known as the most well-known futanari manga in the West ([4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiki_Yui#:~:text=Yui%20as%20,9)). Subsequently, a wave of creators specialized in futanari themes, including **Azuki Benii**, **完颜阿骨打** (pen name), **Suehirogari (すえひろがり)**, and **Misakura Nankotsu (みさくらなんこつ)**. Their efforts expanded futanari from a niche hobby to a commercial market phenomenon, quickly turning it into a popular trend ([3](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E6%89%B6%E4%BB%96%E9%82%A3%E8%A3%A1#:~:text=Party%20...%20brought%20the%20futanari%20trend.)). Many manga artists built reputations through futanari-themed works, fusing “moe” elements with fetish aspects, thus broadening the subgenre.

### East–West Cultural Reception Differences

While futanari originated in Japan, its reception and expression differ in Japan vs. the West. In Japan, it’s treated as one segment of the **adult-oriented subculture** alongside other erotic topics, with fans mostly from the otaku community. Japan’s adult media has historically been relatively tolerant of so-called “perverted” (hentai) content, although the law demands partial censorship (e.g., mosaic over genitals) ([5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Japan#:~:text=obscene%20content%20does%20exist%20and,been%20made%20based%20on%20this)). With the overseas release of adult animations such as *La Blue Girl* and the western publication of Yui Toshiki’s manga, Western audiences discovered futanari. Anime fans abroad soon adopted “Futanari” as a standard label for such characters/works, spreading it online. Yet in mainstream Western culture, futanari remains a niche pornographic fantasy with a small demographic mostly among anime/gaming fans—some perceive it as a “fetish” branch of hentai. Jason Thompson, a Japan-based critic, has noted that futanari commands a wide market and influenced other “abnormal/fetish” topics. Overall, in Japan it’s more accepted and treated as an extension of ACG content, while in the West it is widely viewed as **curiosity/erotic** material. With globalization of ACG, younger Western fans have grown more accepting. Nonetheless, confusion sometimes arises when people conflate futanari with transgender or intersex realities (discussed later). In Japanese usage, “扶她” is strictly for fictional characters, not real trans/intersex individuals ([2](https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/futanari/#:~:text=Today%2C%20futanari%20is%20used%20by,as%20to%20the%20characters%20themselves)). In Chinese communities, the [Futanari and Intersex Document Novel Archive](https://fnovel.cdtsf.com/) has also collected a large number of novels and documents related to futanari culture.

## Art and Creative Expression

### Forms in Anime and Manga

Futanari themes flourish mainly in **adult manga and anime**, commonly found in H-manga and hentai OVAs. In manga, beyond the aforementioned works by Yui Toshiki (e.g., *Hot Tails*), numerous adult manga magazines also publish futanari series. For instance, Mediax in Japan released magazines dedicated to futanari (e.g., *ふたなりッ娘High!*), Issuisha published *ふたなりっ娘らばーず*, Akaneshinsha had *ふたなりっ娘LOVE*, Kōsaidō put out *ふたなりっ娘プリティ！*, all evidence of futanari’s popularity in adult publishing. Typically, these works show **cute female characters with an exaggerated male penis**, often with comedic or fantasy plotlines. Early futanari manga sometimes retained female genitalia, while more recent works often depict “female body + penis,” occasionally with or without testicles—leading to “with-balls” vs. “no-balls” variants.

Animation rarely shows overt futanari on **TV anime**, but some adult OVAs specifically center on it. A notable example is the *ふた部!! (Futa-bu!!)* OVA series around 2014, adapted from Bosshi’s adult manga, focusing on a high school “futanari club” with sweet love themes. Fans hail it as a “pure-love style” futanari highlight ([6](https://www.163.com/dy/article/C1LBUPL30517B2AF.html#:~:text=2D%E5%8A%A8%E7%94%BB%E6%96%B9%E9%9D%A2%EF%BC%8C...)). These “all-girl yet all with male genitalia” stories depict intimate relationships among female characters and group narratives. Some comprehensive adult anime or game-based OVAs also include futanari content as an episode or side feature. In the realm of fan-made animations and 3D productions, some Japanese indie teams (e.g., MIMI*A**Cute**) have produced 3D futanari series with steadily evolving quality, attracting a following.

### Novels and Games

Futanari themes also appear in fiction and games, though less frequently compared to manga/anime. In online fiction and dojinshi circles, one can find erotic futanari stories, though they are scarce ([7](https://nga.178.com/read.php?tid=38189957#:~:text=...futanari%20text...), [8](http://www.jjwxc.net/oneauthor.php?authorid=1348721#:~:text=Futanari%20...)). Some Chinese-language web novels have integrated futanari for novelty. In **adult gaming**, some Japanese galgames/eroges incorporate futanari. A highlight is *Rondo Duo -Yoake no Fortesimo-*, considered a milestone futa game featuring 2.5D visuals with elaborate futanari CG. The story involves a girl cursed to grow a “little penis,” who “infects” other girls. The game is a large 10GB production, showcasing a robust budget and an established audience ([6](https://www.163.com/dy/article/C1LBUPL30517B2AF.html#:~:text=The%20game%20reached%2010G%2C...)). Besides fully futanari-focused games, some adult AVG titles have optional futanari routes, but rarely see official localization due to cost. In Japan, fans can get them at dojin events or via adult gaming magazines.

### Representative Works and Creators

In futanari’s development, several works and creators stand out. In manga, we have **Yui Toshiki** and his *Hot Tails* series ([4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiki_Yui#:~:text=Yui%20as%20,9)); **Azuki Benii** created the *COMIC Kurenai* series with refined drawings of futanari characters; **Misakura Nankotsu** is known for flamboyant style and multiple futanari dojin volumes. Others like **Onizuki Aruchu**, **DISTANCE**, etc., have also ventured into futanari. In dojin circles, each Comic Market sees futanari dojinshi for sale, though official derivative works that transform popular female characters into futanari are rarer due to copyright. Nonetheless, many dojin authors or circles publish futa dojin books, forming a dedicated fan base.  

### Visual Arts and Dojin Culture Impact

Futanari, as a unique visual fantasy, exerts influence on illustrators and dojin culture. **Fan artists** often like challenging this boundary-pushing topic. Platforms such as Pixiv have numerous user submissions tagged “ふたなり.” Many involve “futanarifying” popular female characters with a male organ, generating comedic or shocking contrast. This phenomenon has even given rise to specialized futanari dojin gatherings—such as the annual **“Futaket”** (ふたけっと), a dojin event focused on futanari. Moreover, futanari saturates unofficial tie-in projects: fans may produce futanari versions of mainstream works, or “gender swap” male characters from well-known series—like Kyon from *Haruhi Suzumiya*. Although that’s not strictly futanari, it still shows a broader interest in messing with gender. Essentially, **futanari**—as an art form—enriches the dojin ecosystem, providing creators with a new channel for exploring gender imagination.

## Psychological and Sociological Perspectives

### Psychological Drivers Behind Futanari Fantasies

The swift popularity of futanari is rooted in complex psychological and cultural factors. Some commentators link it to a general curiosity toward “transformation” or “transsexual” porn in the West. Others note that futanari merges with “yuri” (female–female romance) and possibly “yaoi” (BL) fandom. Specifically, futanari often depicts sexual relationships among female characters, making it akin to yuri, thus appealing to yuri-liking male fans. At the same time, the presence of the penis satisfies the male gaze for “penetrative” acts. In the 1990s, as yuri soared in Japan, many saw futanari as an outgrowth—replacing strap-ons or toys in lesbian settings with a spontaneously present male organ, intensifying the erotic dynamic ([3](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E6%89%B6%E4%BB%96%E9%82%A3%E8%A3%A1#%E7%99%BE%E5%90%88%E6%9B%B2%E7%9A%84%E5%AF%B9%E6%AF%94)). This **unreal** concept simultaneously preserves an all-female emotional bond yet gives a “male-coded” sexual element, effectively “the best of both worlds.” As manga artist **Ōh! Great (大暮维人)** said, seeing a female with a penis can amplify a heterosexual male’s fantasy: an unusual female figure that becomes “the ultimate object of male desire,” bridging the desire for female looks and male sexual functionality ([3](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E6%89%B6%E4%BB%96%E9%82%A3%E8%A3%A1#%E5%BC%95%E8%AF%B4)). Some male readers are more invested in these characters’ stories and form a closeness psychologically.

Nonetheless, the futanari audience is not exclusively male. In Japanese fandom, some female readers also enjoy “gender-bending” or “exotic” erotica. For instance, certain fujoshi (female BL fans) show interest in futanari. They may admire the character’s androgynous charm, combining female beauty and male symbolism. A portion of fans see futanari as a symbol that disrupts binary gender, finding resonance with broader gender identity themes. Another angle is the “transformation” aspect: some stories depict a typical male or female spontaneously growing additional organs via magic or science, fulfilling a body-mod or metamorphosis fantasy. However, such transformation arcs are a minority: most futanari works depict the character as female from the start, with an extra penis, focusing on sexual encounters rather than identity dilemmas. It underscores that futanari is **fantastical rather than realistic**, aiming for unusual erotic stimuli rather than a deep portrayal of real trans experiences.

### Social Acceptance and Controversies

As an adult fantasy genre, futanari’s acceptance varies by subculture. In otaku or adult anime circles, it’s considered just another niche fetish, legal so long as it abides by adult regulations. In mainstream eyes, though, it’s often seen as bizarre and taboo, since it revolves around “modified genitals.” Some conservative views call it obscene or pathological. Hence, futanari remains mostly relegated to adult websites and dojin events. Main controversies cluster around:

- **Relationship to LGBTQ+ Topics**: Futanari characters appear to blur male/female lines, but do not equate with real transgender or intersex persons. This “fantasy hermaphrodite” can upset some trans or intersex individuals, feeling fetishized or objectified by hentai portrayals. In the English-speaking world, calling a real trans person “futa” may be offensive, reminiscent of calling them “hermaphrodite” or “tranny.” So there’s debate whether futanari is a harmless fantasy or fosters harmful illusions about trans people. In Japan, since “futanari” only refers to fictional ACG usage (real intersex is “半陰陽” or “intersex”), conflict is smaller. In the West, though, many link “futanari” to crossdressing or “futanari cosplay,” fueling controversies.  
- **Gender Stereotypes**: Futanari works are typically **hyper-idealized**: a female-coded face and body plus the sexual function of a man. That can bolster unrealistic male fantasies, expecting real women to be similarly “omnipotent.” Also, these works often skip psychological or societal reflections, reducing the character to a sexual tool. Some argue this double objectification of both women and trans persons. But others believe most fans separate fantasy from reality, so the harm is overstated.  
- **Cultural Context Gaps**: In Japan’s ACG subculture, futanari is just another adult curiosity unconnected with activism or real-life identity. However, in Western contexts, anything bridging gender lines tends to be folded into LGBTQ+ discourse. This mismatch can cause misunderstandings: Westerners who see “futa” might assume it’s referring to a real trans woman in a derogatory sense, not a purely fictional anime trope. There have been controversies on social media where someone condemned “Futa” as a slur, inciting debate and mockery. For the most part, futanari is fantasy content, but because it involves sensitive bodily themes, its **ethical boundary** remains a focal point.

## Fan Culture and Community

### Online Spread and Community Formation

Futanari’s wide reach owes much to the **internet**. In the 21st century, as global anime fandom blossomed on forums and social media, futanari spread worldwide. Early on, Japan’s 2ch or the /d/ board on 4chan in English had threads discussing futanari. Nowadays, **online communities** provide a platform for sharing images, links, and discussion ([11](https://bluenotary.us/futa-meaning/#:~:text=Online%20communities%20provide%20a%20platform,the%20understanding%20of%20futa%E2%80%99s%20impact)). Many anime boards (like Futaba Channel in Japan, or specialized anime forums overseas) host futanari threads. On social media, Twitter has artists posting futanari art, and Reddit hosts **/r/futanari**. Fans can remain anonymous, freely discussing the fetish side of the topic. Adult manga sites (e.g., E-Hentai, “N-Hentai,” etc.) also have a “Futanari” tag, letting fans find and share content. Through the internet, futanari formed a cross-lingual, cross-regional **global community** with in-jokes, references, and subcultural identity. E.g., in English fans may call themselves “futa lover,” while Chinese fans ironically call themselves “孤睾战士” (“one-ball warriors”)—a comedic expression of how obsessed they are ([6](https://www.163.com/dy/article/C1LBUPL30517B2AF.html#:~:text=At%20this%20point%2C%20you%E2%80%99ve%20become%20a%20lone%20testicle%20warrior.)). Such jargon cements in-group identity and fosters a lively communal spirit.

### Fan Creations and Dojin Circles

Futanari fans aren’t just passive consumers; many are **active creators**. Since official or mainstream titles rarely incorporate futanari, **dojin/fan production** is the main route for fulfilling fandom wishes. Illustrators and authors post fan fiction or fan art depicting popular female characters as futanari. This user-generated content enriches the community and spurs conversation. In Japan, dojinshi events (Comic Market, Comic1☆, etc.) frequently have futanari dojin for sale. Some circles exclusively publish futanari anthologies, building stable fan followings—e.g., MEGAMI’s *Futanari Festa* series. Outside Japan, on sites like Archive of Our Own or FanFiction.Net, one also sees futanari works ([12](https://m.fanfiction.net/community/futa_lovers/85959/99/0/1#:~:text=futa%20lovers%20,try%20to%20get%20it%20in)). This cross-cultural fandom shares the same subgenre. Each year, Japan holds a special futanari dojin event **“Futaket”** (ふたけっと) featuring futanari-themed circles selling original works, an in-person fan festival. Hence, the futanari community is vibrant and **creator-driven**, collectively constructing a private fantasy universe.

### Primary Audiences and Cultural Traits

Futanari fans show noticeable demographics. **Men** comprise the **majority**. Especially among typical male otaku, futanari is popular—these fans often also enjoy yuri, wanting all-female casts but also “male-coded” sexual content. Futanari perfectly meets that need ([3](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E6%89%B6%E4%BB%96%E9%82%A3%E8%A3%A1#:~:text=Regarding%20female%20same%2Dsex%20love%20and%20the%20role%20of%20the%20penis.)). They’re typically young to middle-aged, well-versed in 2D culture, open to niche sexual fantasies, and use lighthearted banter about “with-balls” or “no-balls.” However, **female fans**—though a minority—also exist. Some fujoshi and female-oriented 2D hobbyists appreciate futanari’s ambiguous spin on gender or find the designs appealing. They may incorporate futanari into their own creative works. In terms of orientation, not all fans are heterosexual men. Some are bisexual, pansexual, or genderqueer, seeing futanari content as subverting the standard gender binary. But overall, most treat it as **erotic entertainment** rather than an identity statement.

Culturally, futanari fans are typically deep into 2D subculture. They appreciate the comedic, fantasy-driven approach. This group remains discreet in broader society but is highly active among themselves, developing **tolerant** attitudes toward various fetishes. That helps foster some **dialogue** about gender fluidity and identity ([11](https://bluenotary.us/futa-meaning/#:~:text=Online%20communities%20provide%20a%20platform,the%20understanding%20of%20futa%E2%80%99s%20impact)). Some fans report that encountering futanari works and forums made them more open-minded about sexuality and gender, even though futanari itself is purely fictional. So in a sense, futanari fan culture is both **entertaining** and an inadvertent prompt for thinking about gender constructs.

**In Short**: “Futanari,” in the realm of Japanese 2D imagination, merges the attributes of both sexes into a single female-coded character—its popularity stems from that boundary-breaking sexual fantasy. With deep historical roots in Japanese cultural conceptions of dual-sex bodies, futanari fully developed in modern adult manga/anime, producing numerous well-known works and specialized magazines. Sociologically, it reflects certain consumer psychologies about sexuality and stirs debate about real vs. fictional gender expression. Legally, it is regulated like other adult material. In fan communities, futanari thrives, fostering an **active, creative subculture**. As an experimental expression of sex and fantasy in the 2D world, it will keep evolving in the internet age, sparking further **discussions** of gender and desire ([11](https://bluenotary.us/futa-meaning/#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Cfuta%E2%80%9D%20involves..., [11](https://bluenotary.us/futa-meaning/#:~:text=Futa%20plays%20a%20significant%20role...)).
